Check the version of your Chrome browser. Probably it is one with a bug. Here are bug reports posted on May about this feature not working: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=857032

I have faced the same issue few weeks ago and here is how I managed to get disabled CORS: Firstly download the Chromium browser or Chrome canary browser, which are actually very good for developers (I user chromium, but it is up to you): https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/canary/ or https://download-chromium.appspot.com/

Then:

Install browser
If you run browser - close it and make sure that there is no more running instances
Then run it with such command: open -a ChromiumOrCanaryPathHere --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir"
